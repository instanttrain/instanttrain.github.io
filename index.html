			<h2> My design philosophy </h2>
				<h3> &#10097; &nbsp; Gameplay is story, story is gameplay </h3>
				<div class = "section-content-para">
					<p> Telling a story <i> within </i> the mechanics of a game is one of my favorite parts of game design. The best way to leverage the unique strengths of our medium is to mindfully design 
					
					Being mindful about how mechanics inform characterization and the worlds my casts inhabit is, in my opinion, the best way to utilize the strengths of the medium. Continually asking how mechanics inform my characters and the worlds they inhabit is one of the best parts of design. </p>
				</div>
				<h3> &#10097; &nbsp; Invest in believability </h3>
				<div class = "section-content-para">
					<p> Verisimilitude has countless vectors, many of which don't stop at photorealism. I've found that focusing my efforts on ways to make my games feel surprising and alive (extra dialogue and other responses to player input, for example) is the best way to make my work shine. </p>
				</div>
				<h3> &#10097; &nbsp; Understand players to understand games </h3>
				<div class = "section-content-para">
					<p> Game design is a line of work that benefits from trying to understand the person behind the controller. The best tools to understand player motivation are open eyes and ears to discover peoples' needs, wants, and hopes. </p>
