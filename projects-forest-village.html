			<h1> Forest Village (Unreal Engine) </h1>
				<p> This was a showcase piece designed to create a stylized environment in Unreal Engine 4. </p>
				
				<p> Rustic environments are always such a pleasure to work in - it always feels like sculpting together a tiny diorama with all the natural touches like blades of grass. I enjoyed scripting the camera's movement through the scene; it was reminiscent of coding a rail-shooter environment. </p>
