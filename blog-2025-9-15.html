				<p> I've been thinking a lot lately about the roots of storytelling - more specifically, about how much of what we enjoy today is timeless. </p>
				
				<p> The classics have (usually) endured for good reasons. My greater hypothesis is this: by studying the oldest stories, I can better recognize what fundamentals of storytelling resonate on a deep, human level for audiences. As a bonus, I also get a little history lesson. (Context is key, after all.) </p>
				
				<p> And so, I recently found myself doing some shopping in New York City. I found myself with a copy of David Ferry's translation of the <b>Epic of Gilgamesh</b> at a decent price (by Manhattan standards), and a four-hour train delay. As it turned out, I was surprised how readable I found the Epic - reading a story entirely in poetic verse both keeps the information-density high and the sections light. No better point of study than the oldest surviving story, I suppose... </p>

			<h2> Time and Character </h2>
			
				<p> The Epic has a surprising sense of relative time in its storytelling. The first tablet opens with a description of Gilgamesh that comes across as a sort of eulogy or remembrance: </p>

				<p class = "quote-bubble"> "Of him, who knew the most of all men know; who made the journey - heartbroken, reconciled. Who knew the way things were before the Flood - the secret things, the mystery. Who went to the end of the earth (and over), who returned and wrote the story on a tablet of stone." </p>
				
				<p> Time plays a key role in the Epic, as it relates to its largest theme - mortality and legacy. Gilgamesh's character arc is one of a humbled demigod - mighty and self-interested at first, more somber and thoughtful at the end. Compare an earlier description in Tablet 1: </p>
				
				<p class = "quote-bubble"> "There was no withstanding the aura or power of the Wild Ox Gilgamesh. Neither the father's son nor the wife of the noble; neither the mother's daughter nor the warrior's bride was safe." </p>
				
				<p> to his monologue to Siduri the tavern-keeper in Tablet 10: </p>
				
				<p class = "quote-bubble"> "I look like one who was undergone a journey, like one whose grief lives in his heart. I wander the wilderness wearing the skin of a beast because I grieve for the death of Enkidu the companion, he who was fought with lions and with wolves." </p>
				
				<p> (To be clear, Gilgamesh never quite reaches anything resmbling a sympathetic protagonist by modern standards - he is a brute, a rapist, and generally loathed by his people. To know how much of his character is intended to be admirable in the time it was written would require more anthropological knowledge than I have.) </p>

			<h2> Loss of Innocence and Existentialism </h2>
			
				<p> There is a continual pattern in the Epic of characters content in their ways, suddenly changed by an act of sex or violence, and left with an anxious sense of existentialism. </p>

			<h2>What We Can Learn</h2>
			
				<p> One could argue all of this is in service of a greater discussion on how each Mario title answers the question "how do you make a game where the player has one hit point beginner-friendly?" (to fully answer it would take several further pages of analysis and an addemdum on Yoshi). Needless to say, Nintendo is sympathetic to all skill levels, and generally tries to accomodate whenever they raise the skill floor. For example, when the final boss battle with Bowser was made into a multi-phase sequence in <i>SMW</i>, Nintendo also included Princess Peach to toss Super Mushrooms into the arena during the intermissions.</p>
				
				<p> <b>&#10004; &nbsp; Sex and violence are parallels, and count when they mean something </b> </p>
				
				<p> Sex in the Epic is concerned with its relation to our primordial roots and its function as a boundary between innocence and knowledge. Violence, too</p>
				
				<p class = "quote-bubble"> "A good idea is something that does not solve just one single problem, but rather can solve multiple problems at once. It's easy for people to come up with a good idea that can focus on one problem, but that's not good enough." - <a href = "https://www.eurogamer.net/shigeru-miyamoto-interview?page=2">Shigeru Miyamoto</a></p>
