			<h1> RabidRetrospectGames </h1>
				<p> I was a video editor and Creative Director for RabidRetrospectGames from 2016 to 2024. </p>
				
				<p> Working for RRG was a blessing that taught me much about the realities of games media. Recording game footage is a hands-on process that often requires more time in the editing booth than with a controller in one's hand - one has to be patient and detail-oriented to endure a continuous stream of new releases. Frame timings, sound synchronization, seamless cuts, and careful file notation are all useful skills I learned while helping create RRG's library of content. </p>
				
				<p> As Creative Director, I helped decide what kinds of games the channel would cover, and worked to establish RRG with a unique channel identity. Some examples of my work include RRG's expansion of coverage of vintage Nintendo games and the Youtube Shorts video format, both of which are still used today. RRG boasts 1.01 million subscribers with over 830 million views as of 2025. </p>
