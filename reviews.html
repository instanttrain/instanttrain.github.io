			<h3> Kirby Star Allies </h3>
				<p> <i> Reviewed: 8/5/2025 &#124; Score: </i> </p>
				<p> Solidly built, but didn't move me much emotionally. The Friend Heart system mostly remixes ideas from other Kirby games (Super Star's Helpers, Amazing Mirror's four-Kirbys, etc.). The end result is fun gameplay that series veterans will feel like they've seen it before. </p>
				<p> Some minor game feel issues - Friend Abilities should be a button press instead of an analog stick tilt, Friend Hearts should move at a more satisfying speed. Lore is good. </p>
			<h3> The Mystic Knights of Tir Na Nog </h3>
				<p> <i> Reviewed: 8/20/2025 &#124; Score: </i> </p>
				<p> An unintentionally hilarious blend of Saban cheese and nondescript high fantasy. Just dreadful television, but I howled with laughter all the way through. </p>
			<h3> Porco Rosso </h3>
				<p> <i> Reviewed: 8/5/2025 &#124; Score: &#9733; </i> </p>
				<p> As ever with Studio Ghibli: awe-inspiring in motion, equal parts dashing and crestfallen. Considerably nuanced, with both the beauty and ugliness of life on full display. Cigarettes and coastal wine. My favorite Ghibli film. </p>
			<h3> Ninajirachi - I Love My Computer </h3>
				<p> <i> Reviewed: 9/3/2025 &#124; Score: &#9734; </i> </p>
				<p> Really caused me to stop and reflect on what a unique existence it was to grow up in the Frutiger Aero 2000's (and how distanced that is to modern-day internet culture). An excellent love letter to what was. </p>
			<h3> I Am Big Bird </h3>
				<p> <i> Reviewed: 9/12/2025 &#124; Score: </i> </p>
				<p> A documentary of humility and bittersweetness (as stories that honestly talk about life are). A lovely exploration of the connection between artist and character. </p>
			<h3> The Epic of Gilgamesh (David Ferry translation) </h3>
				<p> <i> Reviewed: 9/15/2025 &#124; Score: &#9734; </i> </p>
				<p> Surprising just how complete it is. I don't get to read stories in verse often. A compelling meditation on change and death. I'm glad this is the oldest recorded story. </p>
			<h3> Survivor: Pearl Islands </h3>
				<p> <i> Reviewed: 9/17/2025 &#124; Score: </i> </p>
				<p> Solid television. A great cast, with a simpler, more straightforward version of Survivor. A great reminder of how important theming is for framing player mindsets. </p>
			<h3> Scooby Doo on Zombie Island </h3>
				<p> <i> Reviewed: 9/24/2025 &#124; Score: </i> </p>
				<p> Much different to watch as an adult than a child. Beautifully animated and charming, but the inclusion of Confederate soldiers and plantations does add a bit of messiness to the ethics of the whole thing. </p>
			<h3> The Three Stooges (2012) </h3>
				<p> <i> Reviewed: 9/25/2025 &#124; Score: </i> </p>
				<p> This seems like a concept doomed to fail, right? Excellent effort by the leading actors, but way too much plot - this would be much better off as a string of gag setpieces with an excuse plot. There's a few issues here - convoluted plot, supporting cast that doesn't bring the right rhythm, sound effects that sound a little crackly, but man, watching this one is like watching a plane fall out of the sky. </p>
			<h3> 17776 </h3>
				<p> <i> Reviewed: 9/25/2025 &#124; Score: Dropped </i> </p>
				<p> Creative and cool, but wasn't quite able to hold my attention. No disrespect intended - I like the multimedia approach! </p>
