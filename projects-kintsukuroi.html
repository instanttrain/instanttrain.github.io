			<h1> Kintsukuroi </h1>
				<p> Kintsukuroi was my first album of music, released in 2017. </p>
				
				<p> In college, I had found myself doing composition work by necessity - there were only a handful of students with music concentrations in my major! I ended up getting my first taste of music-making via those group projects and my Youtube channel, where I posted covers. </p>
				
				<p> Working up the courage to release an album was a scary thing, but it was well worth it. I still feel like I have better songs in me that I haven't written down yet, but I'm proud of what I did here. </p>
